You'll need:
 # An IDE, such as [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] (Eclipse IDE for java developers is recommended)
 # A svn tool, such as [http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/downloads.php the subversion svn plugin for Eclipse]

Check out the hands-to-tuio project under this repository's trunk.

If this project when checked out displays errors relating to missing OpenNI and NITE libraries:
 # Ensure that OpenNI, NITE and primesense are installed correctly as detailed above.
 # Remove the OpenNI and NITE libraries from project's build path.
 # Find where Primesense is installed on your system (usually Program Files on Windows machines) and navigate to `...\PrimeSense\NITE\Bin`
 # Adds the two jars in this directory as external jars to the project.
