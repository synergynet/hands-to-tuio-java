=For multiple hand tracking:=

The application can use two hands but with NITE multiple hands is often not activated by default.  To enable multiple hand you need to find the NITE.ini file.  Under windows file can be found at C:\Program Fileâ€¦\Prime Sense\NITE\Hands`*`\Data\Nite.ini (there may be multiple Hands`*` sub-folders, you will have to make the same changes in each.  Once found you need to uncomment the following the two lines from NITE.ini:
{{{
    ;AllowMultipleHands=1
    ;TrackAdditionalHands=1
}}}

----
=For the development build:=

You'll need:
 # An IDE, such as [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] (Eclipse IDE for java developers is recommended)
 # A svn tool, such as [http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/downloads.php the subversion svn plugin for Eclipse]

Check out the hands-to-tuio project under this repository's trunk.

If this project when checked out displays errors relating to missing OpenNI and NITE libraries:
 # Ensure that OpenNI, NITE and primesense are installed correctly as detailed above.
 # Remove the OpenNI and NITE libraries from project's build path.
 # Find where Primesense is installed on your system (usually Program Files on Windows machines) and navigate to `...\PrimeSense\NITE\Bin`
 # Adds the two jars in this directory as external jars to the project.
